      <h1>Setting up a dynamic website with nginx on Ubuntu 20.</h1>
  <p><em>Try to make a local link from your html index page to any php page. Doesn't work, right?
    It is because our server cannot process files with php extension 
    by itself. It needs help from what is called SAPI or Server Application
    Programming Interface. There are many SAPIs for php but we will use <strong>fpm</strong> aka fast process manager 
    today. FPM is not going to be a part
    of our server and it is not a separate server itself. Think of it as a very simple and effective helper that controls 
    the number of php-processes you run, their upgrade and restart frequencies. It also deals with possible memory losses
    that php is so "bad-known" for. Another distinctive difference between <strong>fpm</strong> and a server is that
    <strong>fpm</strong> does not use http protocols; rather, it uses its own <strong>fastcgi</strong> protocol.
    Anyway, without further adew, let's just go ahead and downoad <strong>php-fpm</strong> and configure our nginx 
    so that it can serve our php content!
  </em></p>
  <h3>Installing php-fpm and configuring it.</h3>
  <p>1. First, let's  to our nginx congiguration file and make some changes as illustrated 
    in this <a href="https://websiteforstudents.com/setup-nginx-web-servers-with-php-support-on-ubuntu-servers/">link</a>.
    (we basically just tell NGINX to proxy requests to PHP FPM via the FCGI protocol).</p>
  <p class="cmd">sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydefault</p>
  <p>2. Install <strong>php-fpm</strong>.</p>
  <p class="cmd">apt-get install php7.0-fpm</p>
  <p>I would also reccomend to go ahead and install the following modules, we will use them later on: php7.0-curl php7.0-cli php-memcache php-memcached php7.0-mysql php7.0-pgsql php7.0-gd php7.0-imagick php7.0-intl php7.0-mcrypt</p>
  <p>Check if it is working correctly.</p>
  <p class="cmd">ps aux | grep php-fpm</p>
  <p>This is pretty much what you should be seeing. If you see fewer lines,
    there is a chance you have done something wrong.
  </p>
  <img scr="test.JPG">
  <p>3. Restart nginx and fpm.</p>
  <p class="cmd">sudo service  restart nginx</p>
  <p class="cmd">sudo service  restart php7.4-fpm</p>
  <p>In case you are unable to restart any of the services, check the logs and go see
    what problems I encounterd on my <a href="troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting</a> page.
  </p>
  <p class="cmd">sudo systemctl status nginx or php7.4-fpm</p>
  <p>3.This is it, you are good to go. Create a simple php file in your root
    folder and test it now.
  </p>
  <h3>MySQL</h3>
  <p>Fine, we have our php content up and running but it really is nothing 
    without MySQL. So let us connect to our database through the vm.
  </p>
  <p>Follow this guide here to install MySQL "server" on your vm:
    <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-install-nginx-with-php-and-mysql-lemp-on-ubuntu-20-04/#step-install-mysql">install mysql</a>.
  </p>
  <p>You should now setup a password for the database and change the user name if you wish.</p>
  <p class="cmd">sudo mysql_secure_installation</p>
  <p>When you are finished, you can log into your mysql.</p>
  <p class="cmd">sudo mysql</p>
  <p>Login as a database user and create grant all preveleges to a new user.</p>
  <p class="cmd">mysql -u root -p</p>
  <p class="cmd mysql">CREATE USER 'lustra'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';</p>
  <p class="cmd mysql">GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'lustra'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;</p>
  <p class="cmd mysql">flush privileges;</p>
  <p>Now exit from the user mode by typing <strong>\q</strong>. Login then to mysql
  again, this time using your newly created username and password.</p>
  <p class="cmd mysql">mysql -u lustra -p</p>
 
  <p>Now, we can write our database from scratch using MYSQL language only through
    command line. But this is time consuming so let's leave it untill later. 
    What we can do instead, we can download a GUI called PhpMyAdmin. It provides
    an easy way to make and manage databases. It is, however, infinitely less secure.
    But with our first test website we might worry about it later. For now, let's just
    go ahead and use PhpMyAdmin.<br>
    Let's start by updating our server's package index.
  </p>
  <p class="cmd">sudo apt upgrade</p>
  <p>We are ready to install PhpMyAdmin.</p>
  <p class="cmd">sudo apt install phpmyadmin</p>
  <p>During the installation proccess, you will be prompted to choose a web server.
    Since nginx is not an option, press Tab and then OK. You will later be prompted to
    create a database. Since we already have our database created and configured,
    choose a No option.
  </p>
  <p>The installation will now finish. For the Nginx web server to find and serve the phpMyAdmin files correctly, we’ll need to create a symbolic link from the installation files to Nginx’s document root directory:</p>
  <p class="cmd">sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/lustra/phpmyadmin</p>
  <p>We can now access our database through a gui. Just type 
    <strong>https://206-12-93-221.cloud.computecanada.ca/phpmyadmin</strong> in your web browser.
  </p>
  <p>Now, there is a whole bunch of security stuff you can add to this, and you can 
    go ahead and follow <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-phpmyadmin-with-nginx-on-an-ubuntu-18-04-server">this guide here</a> for that. I will just go ahead and create a basic 
    database in phpmyadmin. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf0WdxhHtxc&list=PLhPyEFL5u-i0XXGLJawaTNLiXxmSp24TR&index=5">this video</a> if you are not sure how to do this.</p>
