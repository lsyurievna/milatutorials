  <p>Abanon hope all ye who enter here. 
    Abandon hope of this journey being easy but never abandon the 
    thought of the success at the end! Buiding up a website from scratch with zero to none programming 
    experience can be well... hard. But hey, if I, a chemistry student in my twenties was able to do it,
    it means that you too can! So don't give up and, most importantly, have fun.
  </p>

  <p>A little bit of set up technicalities before we begin. 

    I use Compute Canada Cloud as my cloud server. Only because my website is an academic one, and I 
    am still a student. 
    The OS for my VM is Ubuntu20, the OS of my local computer is Windows.
    My server is NGINX (supposedly easier to use than Apache).
    I used php and MYSQL for the backend of my website.
    No matter what you use, I believe the tutorials will be useful to you.

    What you need to know before we begin.

    At the point when you start going through these tutorials, you must already have your remote VM (Virtual Machine)
    up and running, with the SHH connection set up.
    Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFFlkPrGFbM&t=2096s">this video</a> to see exactly how to do that.
    You must also already have your html/css/js/php code ready. These tutorials are only 
    gonna be focusing on how to set your amazing website up and running on the web for the world to see.
    It is not required but I highly recommend you to improve your typing speed and learn how to type 
    without looking at the keyboard. Not only you will be more eficient but also more focused. And overall in the 
    age of technology, it is a pretty decent skill to have. I was personally improbing my typing skills while 
    in the middle of my project, and highly recommend <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/">Ed Club</a>. It is 
    free, and, honestly, amazing.
