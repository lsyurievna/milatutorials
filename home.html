  <p>Abanon hope all ye who enter here. 

    Pretty positive, huh? But it is the harsh truth:
    you should abandon hope that this journey will be an easy one. However, I want you to never give up
    hope of the success at the end! Buiding a website from scratch with zero to... none programming 
    experience can be, well, <em><strong>hard</strong></em>. The reason for that is 
    there is sooo much to creating a website. When I started making my first database
    website (about two months ago from writing this foreword to you), I didn't even know what 
    HTML is. And I know how overwhelming it can be to hear about all those  SSH tunnels, virtual machines, sockets and other 
    science-fiction(y) terms,  the
    <em>pros</em> are talking about on YouTube.
    But hey, if a complete beginer like me was able to do it, you can too! 
    
    The bad news about making a website is, just like hell, it never ends. 
    Once you MADE IT (and I believe 
    you will), you are commited to constantly maintain and update your product. 
    The good new is, unlike hell, building a website gets easier with time. Once you get the hang
    of it, you will actually enjoy the feeling of being able to CREATE something.
    Also, you are not alone. I am working on making a discord chat for all of 
    us who struggle so that we can struggle together by sharing results of our work or posting
    some useful links.

  <p>A little bit of set up technicalities before we begin. 

    I use Compute Canada Cloud as my cloud server (only because my website is an academic one, and I 
    am still a student. 
    The OS for my VM is Ubuntu20, the OS of my local computer is Windows.
    My server is NGINX (supposedly easier to use than Apache).
    I used php and MYSQL for the backend of my website.
    No matter what you use, I believe the tutorials will be useful to you.

    What you need to know before we begin.

    At the point when you start going through these tutorials, you must already have your remote VM (Virtual Machine)
    up and running, with the SHH connection set up.
    Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFFlkPrGFbM&t=2096s">this video</a> to see exactly how to do that.
    You must also already have your html/css/js/php code ready. These tutorials are only 
    gonna be focusing on how to set your amazing website up and running on the web for the world to see.
    It is not required but I highly recommend you to improve your typing speed and learn how to type 
    without looking at the keyboard. Not only you will be more eficient but also more focused. And overall in the 
    age of technology, it is a pretty decent skill to have. I was personally improbing my typing skills while 
    in the middle of my project, and highly recommend <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/">Ed Club</a>. It is 
    free, and, honestly, amazing.
