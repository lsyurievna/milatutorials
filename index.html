        Pretty positive, huh? But it is the harsh truth:
        you should abandon hope that this journey will be an easy one. However, I want you to never give up
        hope of the success at the end!<br> Bui–¥ding a website from scratch with zero to... no programming 
        experience can be, well, <strong>hard</strong>. The reason for that is 
        there is sooo much to creating a website. When I started making my first database
        website (about two months ago from writing this foreword to you), I didn't even know what 
        HTML was. I know how overwhelming it can be to hear about all those  SSH tunnels, virtual machines, sockets and other 
        science-fiction(y) terms,  the
        <strong>pros</strong> are talking about on YouTube.
        But hey, if a complete beginer like me was able to do it, you can too! </p>
        <p>
        The bad news about making a website is, just like hell, it never ends. 
        Once you MADE IT (and I believe 
        you will), you are commited to constantly maintain and update your product. 
        The good news is, unlike hell, building a website gets easier with time. Once you get the hang
        of it, you will actually enjoy the feeling of being able to CREATE something.
        Also, you are not alone. I am working on making a discord channel for all of 
        us who struggle, so that we can struggle together by sharing the results of our work or posting
        some useful links.
      </p>
      <h3>A little bit of set up technicalities before we begin</h3>
      <p>Here, I just want to quickly mention all the programs and services I use. You might have a 
        different hosting platform or use Apache instead of Nginx. But no matter what you are using, 
        I believe my tutorials can still help you in your journey!
        <ul class="home-ul">
          <li><p>I use Compute Canada Cloud as my cloud server (only because my first website was an academic one, and I 
            could use the service for free).</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>The OS of my VM is Ubuntu20, the OS of my local computer is Windows.</p></li>
          <li><p>My server is Nginx (supposedly easier to use than Apache).</p></li>
          <li><p>I used php and MYSQL for the backend of my website.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    
      <h3>What you need to know before we begin</h3>
      <p>
        At the point when you start going through these tutorials, you must already have your <strong>remote VM</strong> (Virtual Machine)
        up and running, with the SHH connection set up.
        Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFFlkPrGFbM&t=2096s">this video</a> to see exactly how to do that.</p>
        <p>
        You must also have your website <strong>code ready</strong> (i.e. all the html, css, js, php, etc.). I am planning 
        to make some beginners guides to that too, but tutorials on this website are only 
        gonna be focusing on how to set your amazing website up and running on the web for the world to see.</p>
        <p>
        It is not required, but I highly recommend you to improve your <strong>typing speed</strong> and learn how to type 
        without looking at the keyboard. Not only you will be more efficient but also more focused. And overall, in the 
        age of technology, it is a pretty decent skill to have. I was improving my typing skills while 
        in the middle of my project, and I highly recommend <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/">Ed Club</a>. It is 
        free, and, honestly, amazing.
